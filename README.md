To train deep convolutional neural networks, the input data and the intermediate activations need to be kept in memory to calculate a gradient descent step. Given the limited memory available in current generation accelerator cards, this limits the maximum dimensions of the input data. Here we demonstrate a method to train convolutional neural networks while holding only parts of the image in memory while giving equivalent results.
